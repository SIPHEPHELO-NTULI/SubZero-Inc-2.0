## Architecture Description

GiveALittle's architecture consists of both front-end and back-end applications, which can all be installed on a PC (see "Getting Started").

### Firebase
Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. GiveALittle makes use of the back-end platform as it is:
 -cloud-based
 -allows for viewing, adding, editing, and deletion of data.
 -allows for us to manage indexes and monitor usage.
 -uses Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore Security Rules to handle serverless authentication, authorization, and data validation
 -keeps your data private and secure
 -very low maintenance


### VS Code
Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. GiveALittle uses VS Code as an editor to run,edit and make the application with the Flutter development kit.

### Flutter
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. GiveALittle makes use of the development kit alongside VS Code for the front-end development of the application. We make use of the Dart as the programming language as it is stable and creates high-performance applications as it is an object-oriented language.
